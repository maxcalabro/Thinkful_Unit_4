      "EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA\\n  The European Community, EC, sold\\n  75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85\\n  and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing\\n  bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S.\\n  Agriculture Department said.\\n      The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per\\n  tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest\\n  report on Export Markets for U.S grains.\\n      EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during\\n  1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in\\n  the 1985/86 season, it said.\\n      The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a\\n  time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat\\n  import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current\\n  forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.\\n      The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in\\n  domestic production, and says government plans to lower the\\n  guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs\\n  will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.\\n      It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of\\n  the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of\\n  U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only\\n  600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.\\n  \\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.675786\n",
      "RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING\\n  The recent fall in world sugar prices,\\n  due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export\\n  availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China\\n  and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.\\n      Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of\\n  China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should\\n  limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly\\n  market report.\\n     \"And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return\\n  to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for\\n  May/June shipment, Man added.\\n      The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May\\n  shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total\\n  purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.\\n      Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln\\n  tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5\\n  mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being\\n  countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3\\n  mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.\\n      Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could\\n  be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar\\n  production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.\\n      Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks\\n  in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to\\n  boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not\\n  be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates\\n  Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln\\n  tonnes.\\n      However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters\\n  with reduced availability, Man said.\\n      Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen\\n  to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes.

      "COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS\\n  The credibility of government efforts to\\n  stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the\\n  test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a\\n  buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government\\n  delegates and trade experts said.\\n      Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when\\n  International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on\\n  how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many\\n  of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to\\n  agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.\\n      The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the\\n  International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses\\n  running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting\\n  a shadow over commodity negotiations.\\n      The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to\\n  compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts\\n  with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear\\n  lines drawn between aid and trade.\\n      A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic\\n  elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in\\n  Geneva at the weekend.\\n      Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa\\n  Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with\\n  quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to\\n  be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would\\n  \"distort, not support\" the market.\\n      Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO\\n  for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee\\n  prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can\\n  founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa\\n  futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has\\n  also contributed to the recent slip in prices.\\n      The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the\\n  \"must buy\" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,\\n  which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but\\n  without rules for the operation of the buffer stock.\\n      Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should\\n  operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement\\n  limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it\\n  cannot operate on futures markets.\\n      A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost\\n  100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or\\n  selling operations, were carried forward from the previous\\n  agreement.\\n      Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on\\n  all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.\\n      The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on\\n  buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be\\n  over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should\\n  pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working\\n  group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative\\n  matters, and the full council meets on Thursday.\\n      Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds\\n  should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member\\n  countries such as Malaysia.\\n      Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer\\n  stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate\\n  manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.\\n      The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked\\n  to the one over differentials for different qualities.\\n      European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a\\n  compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can\\n  represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures\\n  market's existing differentials for different qualities.\\n      Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto\\n  the London market.\\n      Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50\\n  stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.\\n      Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would\\n  operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the\\n  highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.\\n      The January talks were slowed by a split inside the\\n  European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France\\n  siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session\\n  in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground\\n  and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions\\n  among the 12 nations.\\n      The source said the EC will be looking for signs of\\n  flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and\\n  will be able to respond if they are there.\\n      One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split\\n  said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and\\n  backs the concept of the pact which is \"meant to support the\\n  market where trade buying is not.\"\\n      In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their\\n  cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.\\n      Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include\\n  whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced\\n  \"posted price\" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is\\n  buying then accepting offers.\\n      In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that\\n  producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of\\n  cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a\\n  way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.\\n  \\n\\n    0.655100\n",

Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry\\n  of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place.\\n      Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council\\n  session because of a conflicting International Sugar\\n  Organization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon,\\n  delegates said.\\n  \\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.631082\n",
      "COCOA COUNCIL HEAD TO PRESENT BUFFER COMPROMISE\\n  International Cocoa Organization, ICCO,\\n  council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise\\n  proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer\\n  delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates\\n  said.\\n      Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major\\n  producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding\\n  differences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa\\n  the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for\\n  different varieties.\\n      Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be\\n  worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow.\\n      Some consuming member nations, including Britain and\\n  Belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct\\n  non-member cocoa, delegates have said.\\n      The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower quality\\n  non-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will most\\n  effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is\\n  currently pressuring the market.\\n      Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up\\n  at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say\\n  Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it\\n  is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa\\n  Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said.\\n      As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher\\n  differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent\\n  proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa\\n  bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said.\\n      Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way\\n  that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more\\n  expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said.\\n      Other technical points need to be sorted out, including\\n  limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in\\n  nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent\\n  effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.\\n  \\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.624273\n",
