    "# Reuters Multilabel NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I'll explore the Reuters corpus from NLTK using a few different NLP techniques. The corpus is 'multilabel' (which is different from standard 'multiclass'), meaning each article (I'll look at ~1,000) is associated with multiple categories, or tags. This is similar to a blog or website that may have a post classified as 'technology', 'machine learning' and 'natural language processing' simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll use both Bag of Words and tfidf to create feature spaces to run through both supervised and unsupervised models. Because metrics are difficult for unsupervised multilabel models, I've designed a custom function to evaluate accuracy for training and test sets.\n",

      "sichuan braced to fight drought the sichuan government has ordered that any work or meeting which interferes with the fight against drought must be cancelled or postponed to save time, energy and manpower, the people's daily domestic edition said. sichuan is one of six provinces threatened by drought. wen wei po, a hong kong daily, said the drought, the worst for more than 20 years, is affecting nearly two mln hectares in 100 counties in sichuan, the country's biggest agricultural producer. sichuan has experienced temperatures three degrees centigrade higher than normal and rainfall up to 70 pct less than normal since early february, affecting wheat, oil-bearing crops, rice planting and dryland cash crops, it said. the paper said 43,000 hectares in meixian county in guangdong are seriously short of water. the people's daily said henan, shaanxi, gansu and hebei are also suffering from drought. henan's grain output fell by 2.5 mln tonnes last year from the 1985 level because of drought which has been affecting the province since may.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.815419\n",
      "thai sugar production continues high in feb thai sugar production continued at a high level in february, latest figures received by the international sugar organization (iso) show. the figures show stocks at end-february of 2.49 mln tonnes raw value against 2.33 mln a year earlier. analysts said this was a new peak for the date. production in february was 961,000 tonnes against 888,000 in february 1986 and took the nov/feb total for the current crop to 2.25 mln tonnes. production normally tails off sharply after march, but in recent years production from march to the end of the crop has been over 500,000 tonnes, analysts said. thailand's exports in february were 32,800 tonnes and consumption 57,800. last month the thai agriculture ministry said 1986/87 production was expected to fall to 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mln in 1985/86.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.814558\n",
      "pakistan not seen as major wheat exporter pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, sartaj aziz, special assistant on food and agriculture to the pakistani prime minister, said in an interview. no exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said. aziz forecast that pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable. the government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops. aziz said the pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds. the aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said. aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes. this compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's yield of 14.0 mln. he said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly. the long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account pakistan's annual population growth rate of more than three pct. current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes. the current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, aziz said. this compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a \"strategic reserve\" target of two mln tonnes. despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said. the government wants to keep an extra \"safety margin\" until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption. new exports will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well, he said. the new domestic policy, introduced on march 15, is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo. with other costs this means a price in pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo. under the old system, introduced during world war two and due to be phased out by april 15, some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply. aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills. the ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, aziz said. prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system. the wheat price in karachi, the most expensive pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on march 1 to 2.85 rupees on march 30. aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0.810298\n",
      "china seen unlikely to raise sugar imports china will not increase sugar imports substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints and large stocks, despite falling production and rising domestic demand, traders and the official press said. \"despite rapid increases in domestic production over the last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to be extremely serious,\" the farmers daily said. it said 1986 plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated. the official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop (november/march) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year. the yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500 tonnes, the provincial daily said. it gave no year-earlier figure. output in guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the new china news agency said without giving a year-earlier figure. the nanfang daily said production in guangdong province fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the area under sugar was dropping. \"supply of cane (in guangdong) is inadequate,\" the newspaper said. processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good. to guarantee supply of cane is a major problem.\" a western diplomat said sugar output also fell n fujian, south china's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in area planted. he said the rural sectors in guangdong and fujian were wel developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar. the farmers daily said a peasant in the ortheast province of heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667 hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only 70 from one mu of sugarbeet. the paper said the profit margin of mills in china fell to 4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980. mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed with each other for raw materialsx, it added. this resulted in falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills. the price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the official press has said. customs figures showed china imported 1.18 mln tonnes of sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985. the diplomat said stocks at end-august 1986 were 2.37 mln tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier. a foreign trader here said china accumulated large stocks in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority. this practice was stopped in 1986 when the central government resumed control of imports. \"as china lacked storage, much of these imports was stored in qinghai, inner mongolia and other inland areas,\" the diplomat said. the trader said transporting stocks from these areas to consumers in east and south china was a problem, particularly as coal had priority. \"how quickly they can move the sugar is one factor determining import levels,\" he said. another factor was the quality of the harvest in cuba, china's major supplier through barter trade, he said. \"china bought two distress cargoes last week, for about 152/153 dlrs a tonne,\" he added. \"china is not a desperate buyer now. but if the cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into the open market.\" a japanese trader said peking's major concern regarding imports was price. \"while the foreign trade situation has improved this year, foreign exchange restraints persist,\" he said. the diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five pct a year but \"a communist government is in a much better position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the foreign exchange situation demands it.\"    0.786852\n",
      "thai sugar production increases thai sugar production totalled 960,788 tonnes in january, an increase of 12.7 pct on january 1986, according to figures received by the international sugar organization. november and december production figures also exceeded last year's totals with the result that output in the first three months of the season showed a 23.1 pct increase over 1985/86. production in the november 1986 to january 1987 period totalled 1.29 mln tonnes. thai exports in december and january were down, however. january exports fell from 73,164 to 35,910 tonnes. domestic consumption increased 7.3 pct to 192,069 tonnes for the three month period, but this was not sufficient to prevent a significant rise in stocks, which climbed to 1.62 mln tonnes by the end of january, compared with 1.52 mln a year earlier. thai agricultural ministry officials have previously forecast a decline in 1986/87 raws output to around 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mln in 1985/86.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.774277\n",

      "pakistan not seen as major wheat exporter pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, sartaj aziz, special assistant on food and agriculture to the pakistani prime minister, said in an interview. no exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said. aziz forecast that pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable. the government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops. aziz said the pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds. the aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said. aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes. this compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's yield of 14.0 mln. he said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly. the long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account pakistan's annual population growth rate of more than three pct. current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes. the current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, aziz said. this compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a \"strategic reserve\" target of two mln tonnes. despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said. the government wants to keep an extra \"safety margin\" until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption. new exports will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well, he said. the new domestic policy, introduced on march 15, is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo. with other costs this means a price in pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo. under the old system, introduced during world war two and due to be phased out by april 15, some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply. aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills. the ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, aziz said. prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system. the wheat price in karachi, the most expensive pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on march 1 to 2.85 rupees on march 30. aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran.

      "sugar prices too low to boost latin output latin american sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production, official and trade sources said. although prices have risen to around eight from five u.s. cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost. the recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert, manuel rico, a consultant with the group of latin american and caribbean sugar exporting countries (geplacea), told reuters. however, rico said, it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output. \"producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable,\" he said. officials in mexico, guatemala and ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders in panama and costa rica said there was still a long way to go. \"the prices are ridiculous,\" said julian mateo, vice president of costa rica's sugar cane industrial-agricultural league. \"at current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production.\" other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output, given the instability of world markets. an official at colombia's national association of sugar cane growers said they had no plans to raise export targets. \"the market is very unstable. what is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything.\" in 1985, the latest year for which full figures are available, central and south american nations produced 28 mln tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. a year earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000 more, according to the london-based international sugar organization. years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover. miguel guerrero, director of the dominican republic's national sugar institute, said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply. output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from 900,000 in the late 1970s. obsolete refineries, poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output, he added. plans of nearby cuba, the world's largest cane sugar exporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. output is running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970. cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices, since much of its output is sold to eastern bloc countries under special deals. last year, bad weather added to its troubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in 1985. the low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover u.s. and, in the case of some caribbean countries, european community (ec) import quotas, for which they receive prices well above free market levels. progressive reductions in the u.s. quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market. peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the u.s. in both 1983 and 1984. this fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37,000. a national cooperative official said that, as long as world market levels continue at around half of peru's production cost, the future of the industry is uncertain. at a meeting of geplacea in brazil last october officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which, according to the group's executive-secretary eduardo latorre, \"grows like a weed\" throughout the region. brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency. the difference in the price the state-run sugar and alcohol institute (iaa) pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year. soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987, trade sources said. negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point being how brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace. brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with the institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles. however, the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps. sources within latin america and the caribbean hold little hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability unless the u.s. and ec change their policies. \"the agricultural policies of the european community and of the united states have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets, by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries,\" brazil's trade and industry minister jose hugo castelo branco told the october geplacea meeting. the ec has come under prolonged attack from geplacea for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets. geplacea officials say this is the main cause of low prices. geplacea sees a new international sugar agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region's industry out of steady decline. such an agreement would have to have both u.s. and ec backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact. \"they have to realise that the more our economies suffer, the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt,\" geplacea's latorre said.

      "commodity pacts more oriented towards market consuming countries, chastened by the collapse of international tin council (itc) price support operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving, a reuter survey showed. they want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts. consumers and producers, mindful of itc buffer stock losses, have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations. importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey showed. the international cocoa organization (icco) last week set precise limits on what the buffer stock manager (bsm) could do under the new agreement. it imposed daily and weekly purchase limits, prohibited the bsm from operating on futures markets and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. this will help prevent lower quality cocoa from malaysia, the world's fourth largest producer, undermining the market. the cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the buffer stock manager must use when purchasing varying grades. a new international natural rubber agreement (inra) was adopted earlier this month in geneva. importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations. direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases. bank financing was a particular feature of the failed itc buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling. legal wrangles continue. recent international coffee organization (ico) negotiations in london exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said. consumers and a small group of producers argued that \"objective criteria\" should be used to define export quota shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of brazil, the world's leading producer. brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct. the talks broke down and, although an ico executive board meeting starts in london today, delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote. international agreements exist for sugar and wheat. these do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect statistics and draw up market analyses. analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat. an alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups, made up of governments with advice from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber. the u.n. common fund for commodities, with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to become operational because neither the u.s. nor the soviet union has ratified it. u.s. officials in washington said the u.s. doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives, citing the lack of widespread support. u.s. officials in washington and malaysian officials in kuala lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case. u.s. officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests. \"we see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,\" official administration policy states. the u.s. currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the international coffee agreement (ica) and inra - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts. the u.s. did not join the international cocoa agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries, the state department said. u.s. officials singled out the inra as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working. u.s. negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement, u.s. officials said. canadian officials in ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case. malaysian primary industries minister lim keng yaik told reuters in kuala lumpur his country, the world's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case. malaysia is a member of the association of tin producing countries (atpc) which produce 65 pct of world tin. the atpc launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from march to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from 70,000. economist in the west german ministry of agriculture and delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements peter baron told reuters in london, \"agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality, if there was full participation by producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously.\" but baron added, \"no real sanctions are available for a country that doesn't stick to its obligations...the german approach is sceptical. we don't think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries. they were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them.\" traditionally britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with third world producing countries. but recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for \"intellectual honesty\" and \"objective criteria\" have grown. british officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid. it is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. u.k. delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be. a foreign ministry official in tokyo said japan urges price realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply. a government spokesman in paris said france is favourable to commodity pacts. france, a large consumer and producer of sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation, particularly regarding stocks. indonesia's foreign minister mochtar kusumaatmadja told reuters in jakarta: \"these agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical..but it's another matter when there are structural problems..but we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith.\" nicaraguan external trade minister alejandro martinez cuenca said in london producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements. \"the political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work,\" martinez cuenca said. the head of the economics department in the brazilian foreign ministry, sebastiao do rego barros, told reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality. if you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices, it can work. unctad spokesman graham shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.    0.557614\n",
      "ec driving to capture brazil wheat market - usda the european community, ec, sold 75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne fob for march delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the brazilian wheat market, the u.s. agriculture department said. the sale sharply undercut the u.s. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne fob for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on export markets for u.s grains. ec sales to brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (july-june) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said. the increasing presence of ec wheat in brazil comes at a time when the brazilian wheat board, bwb, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year. the bwb cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the usda said. it said the bwb expects the u.s. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of u.s. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

      "coffee traders expect selloff after ico talks fail the failure of the international coffee organization (ico) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in london coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said. prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said. a special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. no further meeting to discuss quotas was set, delegates said. quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the international coffee agreement, were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in brazil. with no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted. lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said. the u.s. and brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. jon rosenbaum, u.s. assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, \"a majority of producers, led by brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria. \"we want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ico.\" brazilian coffee institute (ibc) president jorio dauster countered, \"negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them.\" previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. a majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. but most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce brazil's share to 28.8 pct. consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. a last-minute attempt by colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. delegates speculated brazil's financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some african nations and colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ico's failure to agree quotas, analysts said. the expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates forecast. the ico executive board will meet march 31, but the full council is not due to meet again until september, delegates said.    0.633773\n",
      "colombia helpful but coffee quotas uncertain--u.s. a u.s. government trade official responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers. jon rosenbaum, an assistant u.s. trade representative just back from trade talks in colombia, said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas. \"there is one country which evidently still does not,\" rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to brazil, which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas. rosenbaum said because of the stance of brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the september international coffee organization meeting is hard to predict. he said that during the visit to bogota he held technical discussions with colombian officials. while he did not meet with jorge cardenas, head of the colombian coffee producers federation, who was in europe, cardenas left a \"positive letter,\" rosenbaum said. the cardenas letter responded to a u.s. letter last month which praised colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the colombian plan. rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ico quotas agreed to by european coffee roasters and traders. dutch coffee trade association chairman frits van horick said in amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement. the u.s. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless \"objective criteria\" which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.613990\n",
      "coffee quota talks continue, no accord seen likely the international coffee organization (ico ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into sunday night, but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute. the special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement, delegates said. the council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in september, they said. the talks foundered on sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates said. coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought which cut brazil's crop by nearly two-thirds. brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.612593\n",
      "ico council ends in failure to agree quotas a special meeting of the international coffee organization (ico) council failed to agree on how to set coffee export quotas, ico delegates said. producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often heated talks, delegates said. export quotas -- the major device of the international coffee agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in brazil which cut its output by two thirds. delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.607733\n",

      "indonesia sees cpo price rising sharply indonesia expects crude palm oil (cpo) prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne fob sometime this year because of better european demand and a fall in malaysian output, hasrul harahap, junior minister for tree crops, told indonesian reporters. prices of malaysian and sumatran cpo are now around 332 dlrs a tonne cif for delivery in rotterdam, traders said. harahap said indonesia would maintain its exports, despite making recent palm oil purchases from malaysia, so that it could possibly increase its international market share. indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil after malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure supplies during the moslem fasting month of ramadan. harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary shortage than to lose export markets. indonesian exports of cpo in calendar 1986 were 530,500 tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank figures. \n",
      "\n",
      " malaysia may not meet 1987 oil palm target malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987, oil palm growers told reuters. output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes, unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms, they said. the growers were asked for their reaction to an oil world newsletter report that malaysia's oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year. palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower told reuters. the country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last march, the growers said. the growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from south american and u.s. soybean output. the current south american oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said. in addition, new u.s. soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around november when malaysian palm oil output peaks. they said new planting of palms is also likely to slow, with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years.\n"

      " bank of japan satisfied with yen at current range the bank of japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range, a senior central bank official told reporters. he said the pledge by major industrial nations in paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar rise. unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks, he said. the bank of japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but declined to be more specific. finance minister kiichi miyazawa told parliament on friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the japanese economy. asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a completely unexpected change in the economy of japan, the u.s. or west germany, or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down. the senior bank official said he expects japan's gross national product (gnp) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in april. that would be little changed from the performance expected this year. domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but the external sector will have a negative impact on gnp of nearly one percentage point, he said. he said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy. the economy's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added. the central bank's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said. the bank of japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half. although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said. \"we are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet,\" he added. liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially, he said. the liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices, the bank official said. this inflow of funds into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may continue, he said. \n",

    "Multilabel data is common out in the 'real world', and we've been able to do surprisingly well categorizing it using tfidf with latent semantic analysis and KMeans. With KMeans, we were able to go from a score of 0.54 on the Bag of Words test set with our custom evaluation metric to 0.83 on the tfidf test set. Our model used 32 clusters, and our original data included 15 multilabel categories. Latent semantic analysis did well separating articles by category, and also separated articles by commonalities other than the given categories. This kind of analysis has broad applicability in categorization and tagging of any corpus of articles, memos, or other text documents."
